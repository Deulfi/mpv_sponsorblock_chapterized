(This version generates chapters for sponsor segments, which are detected by uosc and highlighted in red on the seekbar. 
Put <stream>button:Sponsorblock_Button in the controls= of your uosc.conf for a button.)
This is a much more simple version of the sponsorblock mpv plugin.

There are no other functions in this other than the sponsor skipping. Also this 
uses curl rather than python to get the ranges. There is also no cache so the 
ranges will get redownloaded if you watch a video more than once.

b toggles between on/off

Prerequisites:

Either lua-curl https://github.com/Lua-cURL/Lua-cURLv3 or curl https://github.com/curl/curl should be installed in the system.
